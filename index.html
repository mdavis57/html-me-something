                <p>Over the years I've gotten the privilege experience the companionship of caring for pets. Whether they're fuzzy or scaly, I have a soft spot in my heart for all of them.</p>

                <h3 class="Name">Max</h3>
                <p>Max is a Golden Retreiver Chow mix. He was my first childhood pet; we got him as a puppy when I was justa  baby. We truly got to grow up together. Dogs are the best. I recommend everyone get a dog at some point in their life. </p>

                <h3 class="Name">Tiki and Rex</h3>
                <p>I had two Leopard Geckos for over 10 years. They were fun pets to have and it was fun feeding them crickets and meal worms. The geckos (and all reptiles) require a heat lamp to stay at their correct body temperature since they are cold blooded.</p>

                <p>My brother and I each had two mice growing up as well. They are cute and sweet, but I don't recommend them as pets. They don't live a long life, they poop alot, and some can be very mean. Mice are pretty cute though. There isn't much to say about them.</p>

                <h3 class="Name">Maddie</h3>
                <p>Maddie was my hamster. Hamsters make excellent pets, but are escape artists. One time Maddie escaped for 3 days. When she was ready to be found, she just strolled into the living room while we were watching a movie. They are playful and sociable. There are various breeds to choose from... teddy bear hamsters, brown hamsters, gerbils (not technically a hamster, but a close relavtive). Hamsters are overall a cute affordable pet that is a great first pet for a kid.</p>

                <h3 class="Name">Little Butter</h3>
                <p>Little Butter was my black cat. She was sweet and playful. She was named after the WiFi code that came with our apartment. I am actually allergic to cats, but I have found I never have a reaction to black cats. Cats are so entertaining and have many moods to offer. Sometimes they are cuddly, sometimes playful, sometimes antisocial. But a cats varience in moods makes you appreciate the good ones even more.</p>

                <h3 class="Name">Amber</h3>
                <p>Amber is my current dog, a sweet pitbull mutt. We adopted her at three years old and she is now twelve. She still acts like a puppy. Dogs are the most loyal companions. They are probably one of the most expensive pets to have, but they are worth it. They are also great for teaching a child responsibility. Dogs have so much empathy and can read human emotions.</p>
