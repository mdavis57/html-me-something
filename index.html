                <p>Over the years I've gotten the privilege experience the companionship of caring for pets. Whether they're fuzzy or scaly, I have a soft spot in my heart for all of them.</p>

                <h3>Max</h3>
                <p>Max is a Golden Retreiver Chow mix. He was my first childhood pet; we got him as a puppy when I was justa  baby. We truly got to grow up together. </p>

                <h3>Tiki and Rex</h3>
                <p>I had two Leopard Geckos for over 10 years. They were fun pets to have and it was fun feeding them crickets and meal worms. </p>

                <h3>Oreo and Vanilla</h3>
                <p>My brother and I each had two mice growing up as well. They are cute and sweet, but I don't recommend them as pets. They don't live a long life, they poop alot, and some can be very mean.</p>

                <h3>Maddie</h3>
                <p>Maddie was my hamster. Hamsters make excellent pets, but are escape artists. One time Maddie escaped for 3 days. When she was ready to be found, she just strolled into the living room while we were watching a movie.</p>

                <p>Little Butter was my black cat. She was sweet and playful. She was named after the WiFi code that came with our apartment</p>

                <p>Amber is my current dog, a sweet pitbull mutt. We adopted her at three years old and she is now twelve. She still acts like a puppy.</p>
